# BackProject
### This is my first BackEnd project, in this project I created a console application with c#.
### What does this console application do?

1)Adds users to the list <br>
2)It searches for users on the list <br>
3)Edits users <br>
4)Deletes users <br>
5)Saves the listed users in a file with a .bin extension <br>
6)Loads users stored in a .bin file <br>
7)Displays loaded users <br>
8)Exports listed users to files with the extension .xlsx and .txt
